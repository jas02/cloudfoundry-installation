Getting Started
================

Using this documentation you should be able to deploy `Cloud Foundry`_ in easy and (mostly) automated way.

First things first. Please read :ref:`glossary_chap` to be familiar with terminology and return back.

Now, you have to clone repository with code to your computer. Go to the directory (of your choose) you created for Cloud Foundry deployment and run following code:

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/jas02/cloudfoundry-installation.git

I am assuming, that you have installed Git_. Now you should have in current directory sub-directory ``cloudfoundry-installation``


.. _`Cloud Foundry`: https://www.cloudfoundry.org
.. _Git: https://git-scm.com
