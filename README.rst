Cloud Foundry Installation
==========================

Purpose of this repository is to make the installation of `Cloud Foundry`_ easier. Currently there is no easy way to deploy Cloud Foundry, installation is made of lots of manual steps.

To avoid this very error-prone steps, I created Ansible playbooks that will take care of IaaS configuration, BOSH director installation, and finally installation of Cloud Foundry with Diego.
