Cloud Foundry Installation
==========================

Purpose of this repository is make the installation of Cloud Foundry easier. Currently there no easy way to deploy Cloud Foundry, installation is made of lots of manual steps.

To avoid this very error-prone steps, I created Ansible playbooks thah will take care of IaaS configuration, BOSH director installation, and finally installation of Cloud Foundry with Diego.
